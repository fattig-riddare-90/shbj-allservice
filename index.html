                <h3>Our story</h3>
                <p>Welcome to SHBJ Allservice – a partner you can rely on in every stage of working life!
                    At SHBJ Allservice, we are passionate about creating solutions that make a difference.</p>
                <p>Our journey
                    began in 2019 with a clear vision and a strong desire to play a crucial role in the labor market. We
                    recognized that many companies, both small and large, often face the challenge of finding the right
                    personnel at the right time.</p>
                <p>That’s why we founded SHBJ Allservice – a company specialized in
                    providing competent, reliable, and flexible workforce solutions for both short- and long-term
                    assignments.
                </p>
                <h3>Growth and Development</h3>
                <p>During our first years, we established ourselves as a stable and trustworthy player in the personnel
                    leasing industry. Through our dedication, attention to detail, and customer focus, we built strong
                    relationships with our partners.</p>
                <p>We understood that the key to success was always delivering quality
                    and continuously adapting to our clients’ needs.
                </p>
                <h3>Leadership and Expansion</h3>
                <p>In 2022, Fredrik and Johan took over the responsibility for the company, continuing to drive it
                    forward with the same drive and passion that the founders originally instilled. Under their
                    leadership and industry expertise, SHBJ Allservice has continued to grow and evolve.</p>
                <p>It was an
                    exciting time of transformation and improvement, where we took on new challenges and refined our
                    operations to offer an even better service.
                </p>
                <h3>Milestone Achieved: 2023 and Beyond</h3>
                <p> The year 2023 marked an important milestone in our history. We had the opportunity to take on larger
                    assignments, proving the hard work we had put in over the years.</p>
                <p>With each new project, we have had
                    the chance to showcase our capabilities and further strengthen our excellent reputation in the
                    industry.
                </p>
                <h3>Continued Growth and Client Commitment</h3>
                <p>Since then, we have continued to expand, broaden our offerings, and deepen our expertise. Our goal
                    has always been to go the extra mile for our clients, and it is precisely this mindset that has
                    enabled our rapid growth and success. At SHBJ Allservice, we take pride in our ability to adapt to
                    the market’s demands and our customers’ expectations.</p>
                <p>We know that success doesn’t happen by chance
                    – it requires dedication, hard work, and a commitment to always delivering that little extra.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
        <div class="team-text">
            <p>SHBJ Allservice was founded in 2019 by Stig Helge Bruno Johansson, a man with a lifelong passion for
                running businesses. The company’s name is a direct reflection of his full initials, symbolizing the
                personal dedication he has poured into building a reliable and flexible workforce solutions
                provider.</p>

            <p>Before starting SHBJ Allservice, Stig had worked for another company but found himself craving more
                challenges and independence. He wanted to create something of his own—something that would not only
                provide a service but also open doors for new opportunities in the labor market.</p>

            <p>When Fredrik and Johan joined the company, they shared a similar mindset. They wanted more than what
                traditional employment could offer. The freedom to make decisions, the ability to shape the
                company’s future, and the challenge of running a business were all driving factors behind their
                decision to step in. Under Stig’s guidance, they learned the essentials of entrepreneurship—how to
                navigate the industry, avoid common pitfalls, and ensure long-term growth.</p>

            <p>Today, SHBJ Allservice stands strong as a trusted partner in the workforce industry. The demand for
                skilled and reliable personnel continues to grow, and with our experience, adaptability, and
                commitment to excellence, we are confident in our future. We are not just a service provider; we are
                a team dedicated to delivering real solutions, built on knowledge, trust, and a deep understanding
                of our clients' needs.</p>

            <p>The future looks bright for SHBJ Allservice, and we are excited to continue growing, expanding our
                expertise, and helping businesses find the right people for the job.</p>
